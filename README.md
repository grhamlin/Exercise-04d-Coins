# Project 4 - 2D Platformer
- Create a 2D platformer containing a player, that can be controlled with the keyboard, a camera that follows that player, enemies, and a scoring system.
- Due: 03/16/2025

## Implementation
**Required Features Included**
- Assignment turned in on time
- Repository contains a descriptive README.md
- No (script) syntax errors
- No other runtime errors
- Includes a user-controlled player
- The player can jump
- Includes at least one enemy
- Includes more than one enemy
- Reports the player's score
- The camera follows the player
- Terrain with which to interact

**Additional Features From List**
- Multiple Levels (3)
- Large Levels (Each one spans several screens and varying verticality)
- Start Menu
- End/Game Over Menu
- The player can wall jump

**Personal/Juicy Additions**
- Changed the hitboxes on the player and enemies so that only the feet of the player will deal damage, but if walked into by an enemy will still deal damage to the player
- Added a health system, being hit will turn off collisions and flash the character sprite 3 times, before returning to normal. The player has 3 hp that is restored at the beginning of each level.
- Falling in a pit will teleport the player back to the surface, and remove 1hp.
- The levels scale in difficulty, adding new elements and enemies with each one. Not necessarily interesting but something I thought about.
